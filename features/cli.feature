Feature: testjour CLI

  In order to learn how to use Testjour
  As a software engineer
  I want to see Testjour help and version information
  
  Scenario: Print version information

    When I run `testjour --version`
    Then it should not print to stderr
    And it should pass with "testjour 0.3.2"
  
  Scenario: Print help information
    When I run `testjour --help`
    Then it should not print to stderr
    And it should pass with
      """
      testjour help:
      """
